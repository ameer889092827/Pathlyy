Grade 9 (freshman): Take Algebra I/II; start Python course (freeCodeCamp / Codecademy). Join a coding club or robotics. Begin GitHub.

Grade 10 (sophomore): Learn data structures & algorithms basics; compete in online contests (Codeforces practice, USACO bronze prep). Build 2–3 projects (web app, simple ML model).

Grade 11 (junior): AP Calculus & AP Computer Science (if available). Do USACO/IOI training; contribute to open-source; internships if possible.

Grade 12 (senior): Polish portfolio, apply to summer programs (MIT Splash, research internships), take advanced MOOCs (MIT OCW), prepare essays highlighting projects.
